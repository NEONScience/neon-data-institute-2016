## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 1

In the first week of the pre-institute activities, we will review the NEON
project. We will also provide you with a general overview of reproducible science.
Over the next few weeks will we ask you to review materials and submit something
that demonstrates you have mastered the materials.

## Week 1 Activity
After reviewing the materials below, please write up a
