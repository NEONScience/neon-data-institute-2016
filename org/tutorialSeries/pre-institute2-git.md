## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 2

The goal of the pre-institute materials is to ensure that everyone comes to the
Institute ready to work in a collaborative research environment. If you recall,
from last week, the <a href="http://neonscience.github.io/slide-shows/intro-reprod-science.html" target="blank">four facets of reproducibility</a> include:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation
* Dissemination

This week we will focus on Git and GitHub. The Git environment supports both a
collaborative approach to science through code sharing and dissemination,
and a powerful version control system that supports both efficient project
organization, and an effective way to save your work.


## Week 2 Assignment

The assignment for this week is to revise the Data Institute capstone project
summary that you developed last week. You will submit your project summary, with
a brief biography to introduce yourself, to a shared <a href="https://github.com/NEONScience/DI-NEON-participants" target="_blank">GitHub repository - https://github.com/NEONScience/DI-NEON-participants</a>.
